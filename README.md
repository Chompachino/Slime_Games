# Slime_Sports
Based on the Flash game, Slime Soccer, Slime Sports builds of the basic concept of the game and makes it more complex.

All the Slime Games in this project are two player local co-op 2-D games. There will be 4 game modes that can be played. They are soccer, basketball, volleyball, and spleef.

# Goal of the Game
The goal in soccer is to put the ball in the opponent's goal.

The goal in basketball is to put the ball in the opponent's hoop.  However, it must go through the top of the hoop to get the point.

The goal in volleyball is to get the ball to hot the ground on the opponent's side of the screen.  There is a middle net (barrier) to stop the players from going to the other side.  The ball has to go over the net.

The goal in spleef is similar to volleyball; however, the sides will be split into sections so that if the ball lands in a section once, it changes color to red.  The section changing to red is a life line for the player, but if it hits the section now that it is red, the opponent will get the point.

There will be a timer counting down to indicate how much time is left in the game.  The person with the most points at the end wins.  If the points are the same it is a tie.

# Requirements
The game requires the user to be able to run a java file, so the game will play.  We used Eclipse to make and run the game.  You will also need to download all the files so you have all the classes and code required for the game.

# Controls
### Player 1 Movement 
Move Left: A

Jump: W

# Ball
The ball will have gravity properties to it, but they may be slightly altered from realistic physics.  Altering the ball physics helps the game to be more enjoyable.
